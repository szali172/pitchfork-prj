## Purpose
##### Leading Question: Is Pitchfork, "The Most Trusted Voice in Music" biased?
###### This application is intended for analyzing Pitchfork's reviews and determining if there exists any bias. The *All Reviews* tab will show all reviews by Genre. There is a button to display only albums that were rated as "Best New Music" by Pitchfork as well. The *Artist* tab will allow the user to input any artist and see all the Pitchfork reviews that exist for them up until 2017. I wish to continue expanding this program to make bias analysis more clear.

######    Here are some questions to explore:
######    1. How have the reviews changed over time?
######    2. Are the top-rated artists generally in one genre?
######    3. Who are the top-rated artists? Least? How popular are they?

## Data
###### The data used for this project is from Nolan Conaway's ["Pitchfork Reviews"](https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data) Kaggle dataset. This contains 18,393 reviews from Jan 5, 1999 - Jan 8, 2017.
###### The table and plot(s) on the *All Reviews* tab will contain the genre data and will filter as you choose a specific genre or check the Best New Music box. Each row of the data table is for one review: Artist, Album/EP/Single that was reviewed, Score it was given by Pitchfork, the artist's record label, Best New Music (1 means it was rated "Best New Music" by Pitchfork, 0 means it was not), and finally the year that Album/EP/Single was released.
###### The *Artist* tab contains a drop-down menu of every artist ever reviewed by Pitchfork (up until 2017). The bar-chart displays the scores given to each of their Albums/EP's/Singles.
